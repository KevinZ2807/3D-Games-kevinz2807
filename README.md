# STUDYING 3D GAMES FROM YOUTUBE

For this repository, I mainly push **3D Unity Games** from what I have been studying on Youtube to review what I have learnt from those.

Here is a list of game and what I have learnt from those so far:

## 0. First-person Main Scene

Just a scene storing moving player in first-person (or FPS) and some boxes that launch a game from below if clicking on it. Currently building map.

## 1. Fruit Ninja:

Please **note** that everything above is just what I learnt from videos, **not everything I have acknowledged so far**.
